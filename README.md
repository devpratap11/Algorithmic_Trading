# Introduction to Algorithmic Trading

In this project, I have implemented some trading strategies in Python to give buy/sell signals and backtested the strategies using Backtrader Library on multiple stocks over ten years. I studied candlestick chart analysis and trading strategies such as intra-day and swing trading. I implemented trading strategies such as mean reversion and trend following in Python to give buy/sell signals based on technical indicators such as Bollinger bands, Moving Averages, EWMA, Relative Strength Index, etc. Finally, I backtested the strategies on multiple stocks over ten years, obtaining a 440% aggregate return.
